# Dedication {.unnumbered}

Dedicated to Donald Mango (1963-2022)

*Don was a friend, colleague, and mentor to us both. His vision, guidance, and deep understanding shaped not only this monograph but our development as actuaries. A passionate educator and gifted communicator, he elevated the profession and all who knew him. We are profoundly grateful.*
